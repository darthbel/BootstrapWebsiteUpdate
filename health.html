			In the past 15 years, research has shown that we need to consider beverages as well as solid foods in health maintenance. It has been suggested that adults consume 1.5–2.5 L of fluids per day, including fluids that are drunk and those in solid foods.
			<br/><br/>Several reports indicate that black or green tea contains antioxidant polyphenols that have a protective effect against heart disease and several lifestyle-related cancers, including cancer of the esophagus and lung as well as cancer of the colon, breast, and pancreas (28–30). Tea selectively induces cytochrome P450 enzymes and, importantly, glucoronyl transferases, which are involved in the detoxification of carcinogens. In addition, tea decreases the rates of duplication of neoplastic cells and tumor growth. Outgrowth of a health-promoting intestinal bacterial flora, lactobacilli, and of bifidobacteria is achieved by tea.
			<br/><br/>Concentrates of tea polyphenols are available in capsule form. Research in this area is active and is bound to extend practical knowledge about the use of vegetables, fruit, and tea to prevent chronic disease. In fact, diets rich in antioxidants may help people avoid neoplastic and coronary heart diseases and other major chronic disabilities and are thought to be beneficial for reaching an old age in good health.
